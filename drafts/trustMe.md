## "trust me" isn't good enough for your team

Experience is great, for you, when you make your decision on your projects by yourself. It allows you to go faster and with more confidence. But if you're on a team, or if the situation is different from your other experiences or things have changed since you earned that experience, you may be putting more weight into your experience that is worthy.

Here are some reasons why "trust me" because I trust my gut isn't good enough for your team.

- No one trusts your gut at much as you do and many people are over confident in their abilities. Get some statistics.
- No one learns from "trust me". You're not learning how to examine or express your ideas more clearly at the level that your listener is able to understand. And listeners aren't learning how to think critically.
- If you ask or expect your teammates not to make emotional based appeals, you need to do the same and should lead by example.
- It can be frustrating and demoralizing for listeners, especially if you actually have the power to make the decision that the listeners aren't bought in on and they will need to implement or maintain whatever it is that your gut decided.
