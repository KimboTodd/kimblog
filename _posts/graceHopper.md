## An Unexpected Opportunity

Years ago, while I was in school studying computer science, I received a surprising email. I had been selected by my professors to attend the Grace Hopper Conference, and to my astonishment, all expenses were covered. Alongside a handful of other women from Santa Barbara City College, I was offered a chance that felt too good to be true.

The initial email triggered a difficult-to-explain feeling if you haven't been in a position like this. I had the thought that I had inadvertently been swept into a program beyond my league. Perhaps I was a backup?

Is this foreshadowing imposter syndrome? Yes, yes it is.

### Why Share My Experience

I am considering attending the Grace Hopper Conference again this year and reflecting on the impact it's had on my career and trajectory. Spoiler alert: after attending, I started applying to internships and very quickly landed one at a unicorn startup, and now have a new voice in my head that continues to remind me I can do this and I deserve the opportunity to prove it.

Over time, I've had the chance to share my experience with other women and girls still in school. If my journey can inspire even one person to overcome self-doubt or at least accept self-doubt but still seize opportunities, then this slightly vulnerable, possibly cheesy blog post is worth sharing.

While browsing recent reviews to see if the conference is still as good as it was years ago, I have found a few mixed reviews. This has also motivated me to share my story here on my blog.

### Grace Hopper Conference: A Brief Overview

For those unfamiliar, the Grace Hopper Conference is a celebration of women in technology attended by 30,000+ attendees with 250+ Speakers, 200+ Sessions. Named after the pioneering computer scientist Grace Hopper and aimed at addressing gender diversity in the tech industry. You can find more about the conference on their [official website](https://ghc.anitab.org/).

### Walking into a Sea of Empowerment

Have you heard the joke "One fish says to the other: How's the water today?" and the other fish replies "What the hell is water?"

Well, that's how I felt, like I had always been in water and didn't know there was anything different. I had been navigating the tech world feeling a little alone and a little different, thinking that my struggles and fears were just "the way things are." I didn't think there was a problem or that I felt any different than anyone else - sure I preferred to take my classes online so I didn't have to be in the classroom with a bunch of boys that were trying to one up each other with their showboating of CS knowledge or loudly bringing up my tinder profile ... or the TA responding on behalf of the guy I was dating in private text messages ... or getting mean messages over Facebook from some other guy from the CS lab. But I didn't really know there was any other way to be.

There in a convention center, surrounded by literally thousands upon thousands of women with diverse journeys – from experienced professionals with doctorates to those, like me, navigating the uncharted seas of their careers and as an adult returning to college again – I felt a sense of belonging that I hadn't experienced in tech before. Talks and panels discussed not only topics like robotics and security but also openly talked about vulnerability at work. Hearing other women openly discuss their challenges, including almost everyone in the conference room admitting to crying at work, was really eye-opening.

There were so many other folks just like me, and some of the things I had been experiencing were completely artificial problems that don't need to exist. It was wonderful to hear that companies and leaders are looking for solutions to make sure everyone can be comfortable and welcome at work and school.

## Lessons Learned and a Path Forward

The Grace Hopper Conference wasn't just a one-time experience for me. I was fortunate to attend again, this time as a representative of my employer. While the networking opportunities expanded for connections with my co-workers, there was a lesson to be learned about attending with friends and coworkers.

Attending the conference with a small group of students that I didn't really know the first time allowed me to peel off and immerse myself in the experience. I was able to mingle with fellow attendees and make connections easily with others that were also alone. The following time, I still chatted a bit with other attendees, but since I was there with my employer, the ability to browse other job opportunities or swap salary information was more limited. Being able to have a quick chat and keep your thumb on the pulse of the job market and what you're worth is important. And for such an expensive conference, I wouldn't want to pass that up.

Beyond the conference, the tech landscape is evolving. Remote work environments and flexible schedules have widened the doors of opportunity. As a software engineer working from my home office, I can skip out on workplace drama and feeling awkward when the lunch table chit chat is sports news. The stereotypical old tech culture has been shifting for years, making space for different ways of contributing. And science shows that a diverse team and teams with more psychological safety lead to better outcomes.

## Advice For You And Me

If you're reading this thinking, "oh yeah, she's special though" or whatever kinds of things I used to think too - nah. There is a huge demand for all kinds of folks including the people that always tinkered with computers since they were a kid and women that didn't realize the possibilities that computers can bring to their life.

If you're curious about having a similar experience to the one I had and attending a conference like Grace Hopper isn't feasible for you, local groups and communities are excellent ways for connecting and learning. Platforms like <https://developers.google.com/womentechmakers> or <https://leanin.org/circles> offer spaces to engage and grow.

If I attend this year's Grace Hopper Conference, my plan is clear – to venture out on my own, open to new connections and experiences.

## In Gratitude To Grace Hopper

One of the phrases I leave with that has been so inspirational for me over the years is a quote I heard from the previous CEO of IBM, Ginni Rometty that goes something like "Growth and comfort can't coexist. You're either comfortable or you're growing. Pick one."
