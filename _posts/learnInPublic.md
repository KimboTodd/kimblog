## Why am I making this blog?

Some time ago I found this honestly inspiring blog post (<https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public>) that resonated with me.

If you're interested in improving, I highly recommend it to you too. If not, in the words of a friend "I appreciate your energy, but that's just not our vibe and we're going to maintain our vibe."

But here are some takeaways:

**Whatever your thing is, make the thing you wish you had found when you were learning.**

**Try your best to be right, but don’t worry when you’re wrong.**

**Pick up what they put down.**

This note is for myself, but to stretch my learning in public muscles I'm going to put it out there.

- [x] Take notes every day. I [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) because it is searchable and my handwriting has only gotten worse with time. Use the links feature.
- [x] Make the thing you wish you had found.
- [x] Write blogs and tutorials and cheatsheets.
- [x] Speak at meetups and conferences.
- [ ] Ask and answer things online.
- [ ] Make Youtube videos or Twitch streams.
- [ ] Start a newsletter.
- [ ] Draw cartoons.
- [ ] Enjoyed a coding video? Reach out to the speaker/instructor and thank them, and ask questions.
- [ ] Go to conferences and summarize what you learned.
- [ ] Make PR’s to libraries you use.
- [ ] Teach workshops.
- [ ] Make your own libraries no one will ever use.
- [ ] Clone stuff you like, from scratch, to see how they work.

A check doesn't mean I'm finished, but it feels good to check things.
