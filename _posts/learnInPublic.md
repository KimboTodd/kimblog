## Why I'm Making This Blog

Some time ago, I stumbled upon this, <https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public>, inspiring blog post on how to get better faster.

Here are some key takeaways:

> Whatever your thing is, make the thing you wish you had found when you were learning.

> Try your best to be right, but don’t worry when you’re wrong.

> Pick up what they put down.

And that is pretty much it. That summarizes the reason this blog exists.

If you're interested in improving, I highly recommend this article to you and you may enjoy my blog too.

The following is for myself, but to stretch my learning-in-public muscles I'm going to put it out there.

- [x] Take daily notes using only [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) because it is searchable and legible. Use the links feature.
- [x] Make the thing you wish you had found.
- [x] Write blogs and tutorials and cheatsheets.
- [x] Speak at meetups and conferences.
- [ ] Ask and answer discussions online.
- [ ] Create Youtube videos or Twitch streams.
- [ ] Start a newsletter.
- [ ] Draw cartoons.
- [ ] Enjoyed a coding video? Reach out to the speaker/instructor and thank them, and ask questions.
- [ ] Attend conferences and summarize what you learned.
- [ ] Make PR’s to libraries you use.
- [ ] Teach workshops.
- [ ] Make your own libraries.
- [ ] Clone stuff you like, from scratch, to see how they work.

A check doesn't mean I'm finished, but it feels good to check things and track progress.
