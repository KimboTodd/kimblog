## Bookmarks Worth Sharing

Wouldn't it be cool when you bookmark a link to know how many other people have bookmarked it? In my Kindle, I can see how many other thousands of people have highlighted the same line of text.

In lieu of that, here are some links to articles that were interesting to me. I tried to give these some organization, but really there is a lot of overlap and these should be in a Venn diagram.
