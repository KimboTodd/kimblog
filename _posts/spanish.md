Spanish

## (re)learning spanish

They say "if you don't use it, you loose it" and I have in fact lost it. What I have gained in the 15 years since I last studied Spanish is the ability to recognize that learning a new language opens doors to other places in the world and other people, and also opens doors in our own minds.

## little ahas

I have had so many "aha" moments about my own language, English, in the past few months since I have begun studying Spanish again.

## ease of expression in a language

I like that learning a new language will give a new perspective on your current language. What is possible to express easily in your language?

Speaking of what is easy to express in a language. What about programming languages?
