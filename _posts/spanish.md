Spanish

## (re)learning spanish

They say "if you don't use it, you loose it" and I have in fact lost it. What I have gained in the 15 years since I last studied Spanish is the ability to recognize that learning a new language opens doors to other places in the world and other people, and also opens doors in our own minds.

## little ahas

I have had so many "aha" moments about my own language, English, in the past few months since I have begun studying Spanish again. So this is a place to keep track of them.

## ease of expression in a language

I like that learning a new language will give a new perspective on your current language and how your culture views things. What is possible to express easily we can assume is what's being talked about.

Speaking of what is easy to express in a language. What about programming languages?
